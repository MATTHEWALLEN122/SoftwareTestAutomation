How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure that my code is functional and secure, I need to encorporate safe coding practices through out the Software Development Lifecycle, and pay close attention to the requirements set by the customer. Some safe coding practices I can incorperate include static testing, inspect third party libraries before including them in my code, follow my companies coding standards, and identify potential security threats early in the design phase. To ensure my code is meeting the functional requirements of the customer, I need to create tests that ensure the goal of the product is being met. Using dynamic testing, you can ensure that all improper cases are addressed, and that each method works together in the over all system.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

To interpret and incorporate user needs, I will need to get into the field and interview my user demographic. This will allow me to hear directly from the source what kind of features or functionality they are interested in. Also, I will need to consider users outside of my intended demographic to ensure the largest numbers of users will find use in my product. 

How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software by defining the requirements, then translating tne requirements into a functional architecture. Getting to the bottom of the problem I will be solving is very important, so defining requirements is a very important phase. Asking plenty of questions is essential in findout out why something is a requirement, to fully understand the nuance of the problem.
